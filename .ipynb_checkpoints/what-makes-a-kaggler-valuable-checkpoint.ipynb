    "# What Makes a Kaggler Valuable? \n",
    "Ever wondered what you should do to add some weight to your Data Science resume? Many of us already have a good notion of what is important to build a strong data science career. Of what is relevant to increase our compensation. But I personally, have never seen a systematic, data based, approach to this problem. That was the motivation of building a model to explain what makes a data scientist valuable to the market. Some results are pretty obvious, but many others might really help you boost your earnings.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Learning how to increase your own compensation\n",
    "We only could do this study because Kaggle has released the data from its [second annual Machine Learning and Data Science Survey](https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/kaggle-survey-2018). The survey was live for one week in October 2018 and got a total of 23,859 responses. The results include raw numbers about who is working with data, what’s happening with machine learning in different industries, and the best ways for new data scientists to break into the field.\n",
    "\n",
    "With access to that data, we wanted to understand what affects a Kaggler’s compensation (we are calling Kaggler anyone that answered the survey). Our idea was to give you precise insights of what is more valuable to the market, so you can stop spending time on things that won’t have a good ROI (return on investment) and speed up towards higher compensation. Following those insights, extracted from data, I hope one day you might find yourself laying down on a pile of money like Mr. Babineaux down here.\n",

    "1. We are assuming that respondents were honest and sincere in their answers.\n",
    "2. This may not represent the whole universe of data professionals (it only has answers from Kaggle users), but it's a good proxy.\n",

    "# Basic Cleaning\n",
    "Survey answers are messy... Most survey softwares dont deliver the data on tidy format, and it is exactly the case of this survey. So we are going to have some really hard work to clean it. First lets just look at some personal data and clean it while we do our EDA."
